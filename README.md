# ElasticSearch & Kibana Mastery 

A comprehensive, structured learning path and knowledge repository for mastering the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, Logstash). This repo documents my journey from fundamental concepts to advanced implementation, complete with hands-on examples, configurations, and real-world use cases.

## 📖 Introduction

The Elastic Stack is a powerful collection of open-source tools for data ingestion, storage, search, analysis, and visualization. This repository serves as my personal knowledge base and a public portfolio to showcase my expertise in:

*   **Elasticsearch:** A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
*   **Kibana:** A visualization and management UI for the Elastic Stack.
*   **Beats:** Lightweight, single-purpose data shippers.
*   **Logstash:** A server-side data processing pipeline.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

My goal with this repository is to build a deep, practical understanding of the entire stack, enabling me to:
- Design efficient data models and mappings in Elasticsearch.
- Build complex search queries and aggregations.
- Create insightful operational dashboards in Kibana.
- Architect complete data pipelines for logging, metrics, and application performance monitoring (APM).
- Implement production-grade best practices for scaling, security, and performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Basic understanding of JSON, REST APIs, and command line.
*   **Docker & Docker Compose** (Recommended for local installation) OR
*   An [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) account (Free trial available).

### Quick Start with Docker
The easiest way to get the stack running locally is using Docker.
1.  Ensure Docker is installed and running.
2.  Navigate to the [`/01-Basics/`](/01-Basics/) directory.
3.  Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to start the stack:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
4.  Access the services:
    *   **Kibana:** http://localhost:5601
    *   **Elasticsearch:** http://localhost:9200

> **Note:** Check the [2-Installation.md](/01-Basics/2-Installation.md) guide for detailed instructions and alternative methods.

## 🧪 How to Use This Repository

1.  **Follow the Order:** Proceed through the modules sequentially, as each builds upon the previous.
2.  **Read the Theory:** Each markdown (`.md`) file contains detailed notes on a specific topic.
3.  **Do the Hands-On:** The [`/07-Hands-On/`](/07-Hands-On/) directory is crucial. Load the sample datasets and complete the exercises.
4.  **Run the Code:** Use the sample queries in Kibana's **Dev Tools** console. Modify them and see what happens!
5.  **Build Your Own:** Use this structure as a template to document your own experiments and projects.

## 📈 Featured Projects & Use Cases

This knowledge is applied to practical scenarios in the [`/05-Use-Cases/`](/05-Use-Cases/) directory:
*   **🔍 Log Monitoring:** Centralized logging pipeline for system and application diagnostics.
*   **🛒 E-Commerce Search:** Implementing a fast, relevant product search with filters and autocomplete.
*   **🛡️ Security Analytics (SIEM):** Ingesting and analyzing security logs for threat detection.
*   **📊 Business Intelligence:** Building dashboards to track KPIs and business metrics.
